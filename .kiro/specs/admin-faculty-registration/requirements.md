# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables administrators to register new faculty members and principals through a dedicated admin interface. The system provides separate registration forms for faculty (with class and subject assignments) and principals (with basic credentials), while maintaining the existing login flow where faculty and principals log in through the main application interface rather than being automatically logged in after registration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to register new faculty members with their teaching assignments, so that they can be added to the system with proper class and subject associations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the admin panel THEN the system SHALL display options to register faculty and principal users
2. WHEN an administrator selects faculty registration THEN the system SHALL present a form with username, email, password, classes, and subjects fields
3. WHEN an administrator fills the faculty registration form THEN the system SHALL allow selection of one or more classes from available options
4. WHEN an administrator fills the faculty registration form THEN the system SHALL allow selection of one or more subjects from available options
5. WHEN an administrator submits a valid faculty registration form THEN the system SHALL create the faculty record in the database
6. WHEN faculty registration is completed THEN the system SHALL display a "Registration completed" message
7. WHEN faculty registration is completed THEN the system SHALL NOT automatically log in or redirect to the faculty dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to register new principals with basic credentials, so that they can be added to the system for administrative access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator selects principal registration THEN the system SHALL present a form with username, email, and password fields
2. WHEN an administrator submits a valid principal registration form THEN the system SHALL create the principal record in the database
3. WHEN principal registration is completed THEN the system SHALL display a "Registration completed" message
4. WHEN principal registration is completed THEN the system SHALL NOT automatically log in or redirect to the principal dashboard

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a registered faculty member, I want to log in through the main application interface, so that I can access my dashboard with my assigned classes and subjects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a faculty member uses the existing login button on the navbar THEN the system SHALL authenticate them using their registered credentials
2. WHEN a faculty member successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the faculty dashboard
3. WHEN a faculty member accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display their assigned classes and subjects
4. WHEN a faculty member logs in THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing login flow without changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a registered principal, I want to log in through the main application interface, so that I can access my administrative dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a principal uses the existing login button on the navbar THEN the system SHALL authenticate them using their registered credentials
2. WHEN a principal successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the principal dashboard
3. WHEN a principal logs in THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing login flow without changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the registration process to be secure and validated, so that only valid faculty and principal accounts are created.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator submits a registration form with invalid data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation error messages
2. WHEN an administrator attempts to register a user with an existing username or email THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate registration and show an error message
3. WHEN an administrator submits a registration form THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields are completed
4. WHEN a faculty registration includes class and subject selections THEN the system SHALL validate that the selections exist in the system
