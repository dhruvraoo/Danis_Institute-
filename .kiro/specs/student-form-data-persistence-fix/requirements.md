# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical issue where student signup and login forms are displaying cached or persistent data from previous users, specifically causing "Kavya Shah" or other user names to appear when new students attempt to sign up for 10th class. The system currently has improper form state management and localStorage persistence that causes user data to leak between different user sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new student signing up, I want to see completely clean and empty forms, so that I don't see data from previous users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user visits the signup page THEN all form fields SHALL be completely empty with no pre-filled data
2. WHEN a user refreshes the signup page THEN all form fields SHALL remain empty unless the user has already started filling them in the current session
3. WHEN a user navigates away from signup and returns THEN the form SHALL be reset to empty state
4. WHEN multiple users use the same browser/device THEN each user SHALL see clean forms without data from previous users

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want my form data to be properly cleared when I log out or when my session ends, so that the next user doesn't see my information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student logs out THEN all localStorage data related to user information SHALL be completely cleared
2. WHEN a student's session expires THEN all cached form data SHALL be removed from browser storage
3. WHEN a user closes the browser THEN temporary form data SHALL not persist to the next browser session
4. WHEN the application detects a new user session THEN all previous user data SHALL be cleared from memory and storage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student using the login form, I want to see only my own information and not data from other users, so that I can trust the system's security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student accesses the login form THEN no pre-filled user data from other students SHALL be visible
2. WHEN a student enters their credentials THEN only their own data SHALL be retrieved and displayed
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN no residual user data from previous attempts SHALL remain in the form
4. WHEN switching between different user types (student/faculty/principal) THEN form data SHALL be completely reset

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper data isolation between user sessions, so that user privacy and security are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system stores user data in localStorage THEN it SHALL include session identifiers to prevent cross-user data leakage
2. WHEN the system detects a different user attempting to access the application THEN it SHALL clear all previous user data
3. WHEN form components are initialized THEN they SHALL verify data ownership before displaying any cached information
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log data clearing operations without exposing sensitive user information
