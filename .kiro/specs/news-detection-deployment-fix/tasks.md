- [ ] 3. Add Django health check endpoints
  - Create health check view that returns overall system status
  - Implement model status endpoint to check if fake news detector is loaded
  - Add service info endpoint with version and capability information
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 4. Update Django CORS configuration for multiple ports
  - Configure CORS settings to allow requests from both port 8080 and 8081
  - Add localhost and 127.0.0.1 variations for development
