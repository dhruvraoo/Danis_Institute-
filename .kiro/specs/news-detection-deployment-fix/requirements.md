# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The fake news detection system currently has port configuration issues and deployment inconsistencies that prevent users from accessing the feature reliably across different environments. This feature aims to standardize the deployment configuration, fix port mismatches, and ensure the news detection API works consistently regardless of how the application is accessed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user accessing the news detection feature, I want the fake news verification to work consistently regardless of which port I access the application from, so that I can reliably verify news authenticity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on any configured port THEN the fake news detection API calls SHALL use the correct backend URL
2. WHEN the frontend is served on port 8080 THEN the news detection SHALL work without network errors
3. WHEN the frontend is served on port 8081 THEN the news detection SHALL work without network errors
4. WHEN the Django backend is running on port 8000 THEN all API calls SHALL successfully connect to it

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer deploying the application, I want clear environment configuration management, so that I can easily set up the correct API endpoints for different deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying in development mode THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and use the correct API base URL
2. WHEN environment variables are set for API configuration THEN the system SHALL use those values instead of hardcoded URLs
3. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback behavior
4. IF the API base URL is not configured THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults based on the current environment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user trying to verify news, I want clear feedback when the detection service is unavailable, so that I understand why the feature isn't working and what I can do about it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Django backend is not running THEN the system SHALL display a clear message indicating the service is unavailable
2. WHEN there are network connectivity issues THEN the system SHALL distinguish between network errors and service errors
3. WHEN the fake news model is not loaded THEN the system SHALL indicate that the service is in demo mode
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages to help users troubleshoot

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want health check endpoints for the fake news detection service, so that I can monitor the system status and ensure all components are working properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the health check endpoint THEN the system SHALL return the status of the Django backend
2. WHEN accessing the model status endpoint THEN the system SHALL return whether the ML model is loaded and ready
3. WHEN the fake news detector is in demo mode THEN the health check SHALL clearly indicate this status
4. WHEN all services are healthy THEN the health check SHALL return a success status with component details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working on the application, I want consistent API configuration across all frontend components, so that I don't have to manually update URLs in multiple places when deployment settings change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are defined THEN they SHALL be centralized in a single configuration file
2. WHEN the API base URL changes THEN only one configuration value SHALL need to be updated
3. WHEN adding new API endpoints THEN they SHALL follow the established configuration pattern
4. WHEN building for different environments THEN the API configuration SHALL be easily customizable
