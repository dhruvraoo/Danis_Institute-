# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current educational news section displays fallback sample data when the API is offline. This feature aims to implement real-time web scraping of educational news from reliable sources to provide users with current, relevant educational content while maintaining the existing fake news detection functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the news section, I want to see current educational news articles from reliable sources, so that I can stay updated with the latest developments in education.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the news section loads THEN the system SHALL display real-time educational news articles scraped from reliable sources
2. WHEN scraping is successful THEN the system SHALL return articles with title, url, and image fields
3. WHEN multiple reliable sources are available THEN the system SHALL aggregate news from at least 2-3 educational websites
4. WHEN articles are displayed THEN they SHALL be formatted consistently in the existing grid layout

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the news scraping to use reliable educational sources, so that users receive high-quality, relevant educational content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping educational news THEN the system SHALL use sources like edutopia.org, timeshighereducation.com, or similar reputable educational websites
2. WHEN selecting articles THEN the system SHALL filter for education-related content only
3. WHEN scraping fails from one source THEN the system SHALL attempt to scrape from alternative sources
4. WHEN all sources fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to sample data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want the scraping logic integrated into the Django backend with proper error handling, so that the frontend continues to work seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend calls apiClient.getEducationalNews() THEN the Django backend SHALL return scraped news data in EducationalNewsResponse format
2. WHEN scraping is in progress THEN the system SHALL use asynchronous processing to avoid blocking the server
3. WHEN scraping fails THEN the system SHALL return fallback data with appropriate error messages
4. WHEN the API is called repeatedly THEN the system SHALL implement caching to avoid excessive scraping requests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the news section to handle errors gracefully, so that I always see some educational content even when live scraping fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN live scraping fails THEN the system SHALL display the existing fallback educational news
2. WHEN displaying fallback data THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message like "Showing sample educational news (API offline)"
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL retry scraping with exponential backoff
4. WHEN scraping takes too long THEN the system SHALL timeout and fall back to sample data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the fake news detection functionality to remain unchanged, so that I can continue to verify news authenticity alongside reading educational news.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the news scraping is implemented THEN the fake news detector section SHALL remain completely functional
2. WHEN the page loads THEN both educational news display and fake news detection SHALL work independently
3. WHEN scraping is added THEN no existing fake news detection code SHALL be modified
4. WHEN errors occur in news scraping THEN the fake news detection SHALL continue to work normally

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the scraping system to be maintainable and configurable, so that I can easily update sources or scraping parameters without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new news sources THEN the system SHALL support easy configuration of additional websites
2. WHEN scraping parameters need adjustment THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of timeouts, retry attempts, and cache duration
3. WHEN sources change their structure THEN the system SHALL provide clear error logging for debugging
4. WHEN monitoring scraping performance THEN the system SHALL log scraping success rates and response times
