# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical authentication issues in the student portal where users experience "Not authenticated as student" errors after signup and login. The system currently fails to properly maintain student authentication sessions, resulting in 401 Unauthorized errors when accessing student-specific endpoints like practice questions and profile data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to be automatically logged in after successful signup, so that I can immediately access my dashboard without having to login again.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student completes signup successfully THEN the system SHALL automatically create an authenticated session for that student
2. WHEN signup is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the student directly to their dashboard with full authentication
3. WHEN the student accesses their dashboard after signup THEN all API endpoints SHALL recognize them as authenticated

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want my login session to persist properly, so that I can access all student features without getting authentication errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL create a persistent session that works across all student endpoints
2. WHEN a student accesses practice questions endpoint THEN the system SHALL recognize their authentication and return their data
3. WHEN a student accesses their profile endpoint THEN the system SHALL return their complete student information without 401 errors
4. IF a student's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect them to login with a clear message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want clear feedback when authentication fails, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages explaining the issue
2. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL show a "Session expired, please login again" message
3. WHEN API calls fail due to authentication THEN the frontend SHALL handle errors gracefully and guide users to login
4. WHEN a student is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect to login page with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want my authentication state to be consistent across the frontend and backend, so that I don't experience unexpected logouts or access denials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student is logged in THEN both frontend localStorage and backend session SHALL contain consistent authentication data
2. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN the backend SHALL properly validate the session and return appropriate responses
3. WHEN a student refreshes the page THEN their authentication state SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN a student navigates between pages THEN their authentication SHALL remain valid throughout the session
