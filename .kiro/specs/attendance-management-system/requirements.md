# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive attendance management system for the educational institute. The system allows administrators to mark student attendance by class grade (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) and enables students to view their complete attendance history. The system provides date-based attendance tracking with the ability to view and modify historical records.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to access an attendance management interface with class-specific cards, so that I can efficiently manage attendance for different grade levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator navigates to the attendance section THEN the system SHALL display four card buttons labeled "9th", "10th", "11th", and "12th"
2. WHEN the administrator clicks on a class card THEN the system SHALL display all students enrolled in that specific grade
3. IF no students are enrolled in a class THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message indicating no students found

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to mark individual student attendance as Present or Absent, so that I can maintain accurate attendance records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator views a class student list THEN the system SHALL display each student with Present/Absent toggle options
2. WHEN the administrator selects Present or Absent for a student THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the selection
3. WHEN the administrator marks attendance THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate entries for the same student on the same date
4. IF attendance already exists for a student on a specific date THEN the system SHALL display the existing status and allow modification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to submit attendance records for multiple students simultaneously, so that I can efficiently save attendance data to the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator completes marking attendance for students THEN the system SHALL provide a submit button
2. WHEN the administrator clicks submit THEN the system SHALL save all attendance records to the database
3. IF the submission is successful THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message
4. IF the submission fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and retain the marked data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to use a date picker to view or modify attendance for previous dates, so that I can manage historical attendance records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator accesses the attendance interface THEN the system SHALL display a date picker defaulting to the current date
2. WHEN the administrator selects a different date THEN the system SHALL load existing attendance records for that date
3. WHEN the administrator modifies attendance for a previous date THEN the system SHALL update the existing records
4. IF no attendance records exist for a selected date THEN the system SHALL allow new attendance entry

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student, I want to view my complete attendance history from my dashboard, so that I can track my attendance record over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student logs into their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display an attendance history section
2. WHEN the student views their attendance history THEN the system SHALL show date and status (Present/Absent) for each record
3. WHEN the student accesses attendance history THEN the system SHALL display records in chronological order
4. IF the student has no attendance records THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want attendance data to be stored with proper relationships and constraints, so that data integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attendance is recorded THEN the system SHALL store a foreign key reference to the student/user
2. WHEN attendance is recorded THEN the system SHALL store the specific date as a DateField
3. WHEN attendance is recorded THEN the system SHALL store the status as a boolean (True for present, False for absent)
4. WHEN attendance is recorded THEN the system SHALL enforce unique constraint ensuring one record per student per day
5. IF duplicate attendance entry is attempted THEN the system SHALL update the existing record instead of creating a new one

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want RESTful API endpoints for attendance management, so that the frontend can interact with attendance data efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend requests student list for a class THEN the API SHALL provide GET endpoint with class_grade and date parameters
2. WHEN the frontend requests attendance data THEN the API SHALL return students list and existing attendance records
3. WHEN the frontend submits attendance data THEN the API SHALL provide POST endpoint accepting multiple student attendance records
4. WHEN attendance is submitted via API THEN the system SHALL use update_or_create to prevent duplicates
5. IF required parameters are missing THEN the API SHALL return appropriate error responses
