# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing real-time chat system to ensure administrators can reliably initiate and manage conversations with students through WebSocket connections. The system already has a comprehensive backend and frontend implementation, but needs improvements in connection reliability, user experience, and integration with the admin dashboard.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to reliably start conversations with students by clicking on them in the student list, so that I can provide real-time support and communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin clicks on a student without an existing chat room THEN the system SHALL create a new chat room automatically
2. WHEN the chat room is created THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection immediately
3. WHEN the WebSocket connection is established THEN the system SHALL display the chat interface with connection status
4. WHEN the connection fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to HTTP messaging and show retry options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see a comprehensive conversation section with all students, so that I can manage multiple chat sessions efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the messaging section THEN the system SHALL display all registered students with their chat status

3. WHEN a student has unread messages THEN the system SHALL show an unread count badge and prioritize them in the list
4. WHEN students have no existing chat rooms THEN the system SHALL show a "New" indicator
5. WHEN the admin refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL maintain the active chat selection and reconnect WebSocket

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to send and receive messages in real-time, so that I can have fluid conversations with students.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin sends a message THEN the system SHALL deliver it to the student immediately via WebSocket
2. WHEN a student sends a message THEN the system SHALL display it in the admin's chat interface immediately
3. WHEN messages are exchanged THEN the system SHALL store them persistently in the database
4. WHEN the chat interface loads THEN the system SHALL display the conversation history

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see typing indicators and message status, so that I can understand the conversation flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student is typing THEN the system SHALL show a typing indicator to the admin
2. WHEN an admin is typing THEN the system SHALL show a typing indicator to the student
3. WHEN a message is delivered THEN the system SHALL show delivery confirmation
4. WHEN a message is read THEN the system SHALL show read confirmation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student, I want to receive chat notifications from admins, so that I can respond promptly to important communications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin starts a conversation THEN the system SHALL notify the student with a chat notification
2. WHEN an admin sends a message THEN the system SHALL show a notification to the student if they're not in the chat
3. WHEN a student is offline THEN the system SHALL store messages and deliver them when they come online
4. WHEN a student logs in THEN the system SHALL show any pending chat notifications

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage conversation history and status, so that I can track communication with students effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing conversations THEN the system SHALL display conversation history with timestamps
