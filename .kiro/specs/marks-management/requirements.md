# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Marks Management feature enables administrators to create exams, manage student marks, and allows students to view their academic performance. This system provides a comprehensive solution for tracking student academic progress through exam creation, marks entry, and performance viewing capabilities within the existing Django-based institute management system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create and manage exams for different classes, so that I can organize academic assessments systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the exam management endpoint with a class_grade parameter THEN the system SHALL return all exams for that specific class
2. WHEN an administrator submits exam creation data (name, exam_date, student_class) THEN the system SHALL create a new exam record in the database
3. WHEN exam data is invalid or incomplete THEN the system SHALL return appropriate validation error messages
4. IF the administrator is not authenticated with admin privileges THEN the system SHALL deny access to exam management endpoints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to enter and update marks for students in specific exams, so that I can maintain accurate academic records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses marks management for a specific exam with a student_id parameter THEN the system SHALL return all subjects for that student's class and any existing marks for that student in that exam
2. WHEN an administrator submits marks data (student_id and list of marks with subject_id, marks_obtained, total_marks) THEN the system SHALL save or update the marks using update_or_create functionality
3. WHEN marks data is invalid (negative marks, marks exceeding total, missing required fields) THEN the system SHALL return validation errors
4. IF the administrator attempts to enter marks for a non-existent student or exam THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want to view my marks for all exams, so that I can track my academic performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated student accesses their marks endpoint THEN the system SHALL return all their marks records grouped by exam and ordered by exam date
2. WHEN a student views their marks THEN the system SHALL display subject name, marks obtained, total marks, and percentage for each subject
3. IF a student is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL deny access to marks viewing functionality
4. WHEN no marks exist for a student THEN the system SHALL return an empty result with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper API serialization and data validation, so that data integrity is maintained across all marks management operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints receive requests THEN the system SHALL use appropriate serializers for Subject, Exam, and Marks models
2. WHEN data is serialized for API responses THEN the system SHALL include all necessary fields for frontend consumption
3. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return structured validation error responses
4. IF database constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and return meaningful error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper URL routing and endpoint organization, so that the API is RESTful and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured THEN it SHALL provide the endpoint /api/exams/ for exam management operations
2. WHEN the system is configured THEN it SHALL provide the endpoint /api/exams/<int:exam_id>/marks/ for marks management operations
3. WHEN the system is configured THEN it SHALL provide the endpoint /api/my-marks/ for student marks viewing
4. WHEN endpoints are accessed THEN they SHALL follow RESTful conventions for HTTP methods (GET for retrieval, POST for creation/updates)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system user, I want proper authentication and authorization controls, so that sensitive academic data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL require IsAdminUser permission
2. WHEN student endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL require IsAuthenticated permission
3. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL return 401 or 403 status codes with appropriate error messages
4. IF a student attempts to access another student's marks THEN the system SHALL deny access and return an error
