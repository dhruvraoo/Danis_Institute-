# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The StudentMessages.tsx component is experiencing a persistent syntax error that prevents the Vite development server from compiling successfully. The error indicates "Unexpected token `div`. Expected jsx identifier" at line 442, which is preventing the chat system from functioning properly. This spec addresses the need to identify and fix the syntax error while maintaining all existing chat functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the StudentMessages.tsx component to compile without syntax errors, so that the chat system can function properly in the development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Vite development server is started THEN the StudentMessages.tsx component SHALL compile without syntax errors
2. WHEN the component is rendered THEN all existing chat functionality SHALL remain intact
3. WHEN the syntax is fixed THEN the component SHALL maintain proper TypeScript type safety

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to access the messaging interface without encountering compilation errors, so that I can communicate with administrators, faculty, and principals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the messages section THEN the interface SHALL load without errors
2. WHEN I interact with the messaging features THEN all functionality SHALL work as expected
3. WHEN I send, receive, or delete messages THEN the operations SHALL complete successfully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to follow proper JavaScript/TypeScript syntax rules, so that the codebase remains maintainable and error-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code THEN all brackets, parentheses, and JSX tags SHALL be properly closed
2. WHEN using JSX syntax THEN all elements SHALL follow React component structure rules
3. WHEN defining functions THEN all function bodies SHALL have proper opening and closing brackets
