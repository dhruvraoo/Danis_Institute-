# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze syntax error location and identify root cause


  - Read the StudentMessages.tsx file around line 442 where the error occurs
  - Examine the JSX structure and function definitions in the error area
  - Identify specific syntax violations causing the compilation failure
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.3_





- [x] 2. Examine function bracket structure and closure


  - Check all function definitions for proper opening and closing brackets
  - Verify useEffect hooks have correct cleanup function structure




  - Ensure arrow functions and async functions are properly formed
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Validate JSX element structure and nesting



  - Verify all JSX tags are properly opened and closed
  - Check for malformed JSX comments that might break parsing
  - Ensure conditional rendering syntax follows React patterns
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 4. Fix identified syntax errors with minimal changes
  - Apply targeted fixes to resolve the specific syntax violations
  - Maintain existing code structure and functionality
  - Preserve all imports, interfaces, and component logic
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1_

- [x] 5. Test compilation and verify functionality


  - Run the Vite development server to confirm compilation success
  - Verify the StudentMessages component renders without errors
  - Test all existing chat functionality to ensure no regressions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_
